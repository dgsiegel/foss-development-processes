\chapter*{Abstract}

\acl{FOSS} is a research subject which has constantly been gaining importance
for modern digital life over the past 20 years. The World Wide Web as we know
it today would have been impossible without the free availability of source
code, vivid development communities and consequent support for open standards.
Despite these facts, there has been little research about the particular
similarities or differences in the development processes and structures of
\acl{FOSS} projects.

This thesis aims to provide an introduction into the development processes and
project management strategies of \acl{FOSS} projects. To accomplish this, a
project analysis catalogue is established with which \acl{FOSS} can be analyzed
systematically and satisfactorily for the goals of this thesis. Following this
catalogue several \acl{FOSS} projects are analyzed in order to identify
concertedly models and processes.

The results corroborate suggestions that especially large and mature \acl{FOSS}
projects have established similar structures and processes. This includes very
hierarchical structures with akin roles, similar release cycles and analogical
development processes which cannot be resembled with traditional or agile
software engineering methods.
