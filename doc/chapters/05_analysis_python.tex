\section{Python Project Analysis} % {{{

\marginnote{\includegraphics[width=\marginparwidth]{python/logo}}

Python is an object oriented, interpreted programming language
\cite{PythonAbout}. It is well known for its simplicity and easy to learn
syntax. Licensed under the \emph{Python Software License} \cite{PythonLicence}
it is widely available for all major platforms. Python comes with an
interpreter and an extensive standard library. It supports many programming
paradigms, such as object oriented, imperative or functional programming
styles. The reference implementation of the interpreter is called
\emph{CPython}, however there are other interpreters available as well. Though
the subject of this analysis will be CPython.

\subsection{History} % {{{

The creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, conceived and implemented Python
around 1989 at the CWI Institute in the Netherlands \cite{Venners2003}. Python
was a successor to the ABC programming language, which itself saw contributions
from van Rossum in the eighties. The name alludes to the british television
series \emph{Monty Python's Flying Circus} van Rossum was watching while
creating the programming language. He still is Python's principal author and
project leader and therefore the project's main decision maker.

Currently, there are two versions of Python available, both incompatible to
each other. Python~2.0 was first released in 2000 and since then evolved to the
currently available Python~2.7 version. Python~3.0 however, was a major,
backwards incompatible release, which was released in 2008. It is the successor
of the 2.x series and will replace it completely in the near future.

Also, since the 2.x series, the Python project created a transparent and
community backed development process with van Rossum as its leader.

\subsection{Community} % {{{

The Python project has a large user and developer community. Many are working
on the CPython interpreter and the standard library, however there are also a
lot of other current Python related projects, such as advanced libraries.

The Python community is very eager to attend and offer opportunities to meet in
person. Therefore, one can frequently attend conferences and workshops
worldwide \cite{PythonConferences}. The first conference was \emph{PyCon} in
North America in 2003. However there are now many other conferences, such as
\emph{PyCon DE}, \emph{EuroPython} or \emph{SciPy}.

The communication inside the Python project takes mostly place through several
mailing lists \cite{PythonCommunication}. Each mailing list stands for a
certain topic, for example the \emph{python-dev} mailing list which is the main
communication channel for Python development. The \emph{python-ideas} mailing
list on the other hand is for future ideas and goals of the Python project.
There are of course also other communication methods available, such as several
\ac{IRC} channels and developer's blogs.

Next to the already mentioned users and developers of Python people will be
classified into several categories, depending on how strongly they are involved
in the development of Python \cite{PythonCoreDeveloper}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{python/commits_by_year}
  \caption[Commits by Year, Python]
  {Yearly overview of commits to CPython. The two peaks appear to match the
    releases of the major releases Python~2 and Python~3.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Developer}

One is able to gain the \emph{Developer} role when they have consistently shown
contributions to Python. There is however no set rule of how many patches or
resolved issues are needed. It is possible to request the Developer role by
asking any other person, who already has the Developer role. They then will
decide if the requester is ready to gain the additional privileges. The
enquired person will sequently act as a mentor for the requester.

\paragraph{Core Developer}

The way to become a Core Developer is quite similar to the Developer role
above. One must have consistently contributed patches, which meet a certain
quality standard. Then normally a Core Developer will be offered the chance to
become a Core Developer. The reference person will also act as a mentor for the
new Core Developer. Also, the core developer group will watch if the quality of
the contributed patches was met and the development process understood. However
it is also possible to request the Core Developer role.

\paragraph{Expert}

Each Core Developer has the possibility to become an expert in a certain area
of the Python project. An expert is the so called maintainer of his field of
interest and therefore responsible for changes and new features to those areas.
All issues, help requests and decisions will be forwarded to the expert.
Experts may also be asked to decide on features or bugs.

  \caption[Time Based View on Commits, Python]
  {Time based view on commits of Core Contributors. It is interesting to note
    that almost all commits happen during the week, however later than usual
    office hours.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)}

Guido van Rossum is the only person who holds this title. As the leader of the
Python project, he has the privilege to outvote and overrule any decision made
by an Expert or Core Developer. However his decisions should always be in
favour of the project, as the word \emph{benevolent} states.

\subsection{Release Process} % {{{

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{python/releases}
  \caption[Major Releases of Python]{Major releases of Python.}
\end{figure}

For releases, Python uses a version naming with three numbers. The numbers
stand for major, minor and micro versions
\cite{PythonDevelopmentCycle,Warsaw2001}. New major releases are extremely
scarce. They are planned for a long time in advance, often with incompatible
changes. An example for such a major release is be Python~3.0. Minor releases
are feature releases with no incompatibilities between its predecessors.
Roughly, they get published every 18 months. Micro releases are bug fix releases
and get promulgated every 6 months, although they can be released in shorter
time periods too. Besides, each release is proceeded by several alpha, beta and
release candidate releases which are testing releases.

\end{figure}

% }}}

\subsection{Development} % {{{

Since Python~2.0, the Python community changed their development process
towards a more open and transparent approach. For each patch, the Python
community can vote for or against it. They can vote +1, +0, -0, -1, whereas +1
and -1 mean acceptance or rejection and +0 and -0 mean an indifferent decision
with a slight positive or negative slant \cite{Warsaw2002}. The voting itself
takes place on either the \emph{python-dev} mailing list or will get announced
on the \emph{python-announce} mailing list. This voting however is completely
deliberative and Guido van Rossum can still approve or reject a patch even if
the voting disagrees with his decision.

The development process is highly dependent on the so called \ac{PEP}
\cite{Warsaw2000}. Loosely modelled on the Internet \ac{RFC} process, they are
design documents which describe either a proposed feature, a process or just
provide information. They are continually discussed in the community and
revised until the community reaches a consensus. \acp{PEP} can then either be
approved or rejected. They are the primary way to propose new features and on
approval are finalized with the commit of a patch.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{python/pep8}
  \caption[Excerpt from \acl{PEP} 8]{Excerpt from \ac{PEP} 8: Style Guide for Python Code.}
\end{figure}

The Python project defines three types of \acp{PEP}.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item \spacedlowsmallcaps{Standards Track PEP} The most common form of \acp{PEP} describes a
    feature proposal for the Python language. They always consist of a design
    document and a reference implementation.

  \item \spacedlowsmallcaps{Informational PEP} Unlike the Standards Track PEP, this type of
    \ac{PEP} does not propose a new feature. It provides general guidelines or
    information about a certain issue of Python. However it does not
    necessarily reach consensus inside the Python community and so one is free
    to ignore Informational PEPs.

  \item \spacedlowsmallcaps{Process PEP} This kind of \ac{PEP} is quite like the Standards Track
    PEP, except that it applies to other areas than the Python language and
    describes processes around Python. For example any guidelines, decision
    making processes, development workflow and others are mostly Process PEPs.
    Additionally any \acp{PEP} which describe other \acp{PEP}, for example how
    a \ac{PEP} should look like, will be defined as a Process PEPs.

\end{enumerate}

The \ac{PEP} process begins with a feature proposal for Python. While all
bigger proposals require a \ac{PEP}, the Python project suggests to submit
small changes directly as a patch submission. A \ac{PEP} always has one or
several authors, who have the responsibility for it. They will begin by
submitting the \ac{PEP} to the Python project. More precisely it should be
presented to the \emph{python-ideas} mailing list and subsequently sent to the
\ac{PEP} editors. The \ac{PEP} editors will assign a number and a category as
mentioned above. Additionally, new \acp{PEP} always start with the \emph{Draft}
status. From there, the \ac{PEP} workflow begins.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Draft}

This is the default state of any new \ac{PEP} on submission, as described
above.

\paragraph{Deferred}

A \ac{PEP} Editor can always, instead of assigning the Draft status, defer a
\ac{PEP}. Reasons for a deferral could be duplication, being poorly written,
lack of motivation by the author or not being in line with the Python
philosophy.

\paragraph{Accepted}

A \ac{PEP} will be able to get this status assigned, if all \ac{PEP} criteria
are matched. This includes a precise formulation of the \ac{PEP}, not breaking
backwards compatibility and finally be accepted by the \ac{BDFL}. However the
criteria are not fully binding and a \ac{PEP} just has to be accepted by the
\ac{BDFL}.

\paragraph{Rejected}

At this stage a \ac{PEP} can still be rejected. Mostly this status gets
assigned, if it turns out that the original idea did not fit the Python
project. The reject stage is just an option to drop a \ac{PEP}, after it was
accepted or not deferred.

\paragraph{Withdrawn}

A \ac{PEP} can also always be withdrawn by the author. This could help if an
author does not want to work on a \ac{PEP} anymore, for example because there
is a better solution available.

\paragraph{Final}

Once a \ac{PEP} has been accepted and has a reference implementation available,
it can get the status Final by the \ac{BDFL}.

\paragraph{Replaced}

Mostly for Informational PEPs, subsequent versions can replace a \ac{PEP}. In
this case the original \ac{PEP} would be marked as Replaced and superseded by
the new \ac{PEP}.

\paragraph{Active}

Informational and Process PEPs can also be marked as Active, if they will never
be completed. For example \ac{PEP} 1 \cite{Warsaw2000}, which describes the
process of \acp{PEP} has its status set to Active, as it is continually
improved and adapted to new workflows.
