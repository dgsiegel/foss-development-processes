\section{Plone Project Analysis} % {{{

\marginnote{\includegraphics[width=\marginparwidth]{plone/logo}}

\noindent Plone is a \ac{CMS} built on top of the Zope application server which
provides the core functionality layer for the project
\cite{Aspeli2005,PloneFaq,PloneWhatIsPlone}. It is mostly written in Python and
available for all major platforms. Plone is licensed under the \ac{GPL} and
according to Ohloh, Plone is one of the top \unit[2]{\%} of \ac{FOSS} projects
worldwide \cite{PloneOhlohFactoids}. Furthermore it is used by organizations
and companies such as \textsmaller{NASA}, Amnesty International, Nokia and
others. It can be used for a wide range of websites such as internal websites,
blogs, groupware and other. The project is known for its very good security
track record, high usability, extensibility and flexibility. The project is
split into Plone Core and Collective. This analysis however will only focus on
Plone Core as it is the heart of the project.

\subsection{History} % {{{

In 1999, Alexander Limi and Alan Runyan started the Plone Project creating a
usability layer on top of the application server and \ac{CMF} Zope
\cite{Aspeli2005,PloneFaq}. The first version was then released two years later
in 2001 \cite{PloneReleases}. It was quickly picked up by many people and a
community around the Plone project began to emerge. In 2004 Plone~2.0 was
released which made Plone more configurable and enhanced the possibility of
adding modules to the \ac{CMS}. At the same time, the Plone foundation was
established, which to this day has ownership rights over the Plone project and
trademarks. The next major Plone version was released in 2007 under the name
Plone~3. The currently used and developed Plone~4 was released in 2010.

\subsection{Community} % {{{

The Plone project consists of a large user and developer community. While there
are about 300 people working on Plone Core, there is a much bigger community
working on Plone Collective projects
\cite{Aspeli2005,PloneOhlohFactoids,PloneCommunityProcesses}.

Most of the communication is done through the Plone mailing lists whereas the
\emph{plone-developers} mailing list is in place to discuss the development and
future of Plone Core. There are also lots of other mailing lists available for
almost every aspect concerning the project. However, there are also large
forums and \ac{IRC} channels available where one can give and find support.

The first Plone conference was held in New Orleans in 2003
\cite{PloneConferences}. Since then the yearly Plone conference attracted a
growing number of attendees every year and was held in Europe as well as in the
United States.

The Plone community is very eager to organize so called sprints
\cite{PloneSprints}. A sprint is a focused development session where developers
meet in person and try to enhance a certain part of the Plone project. It
normally lasts about three to five days in which one person leads the session
and tracks the activities and the development. Many sprints take place
worldwide every year.

Due to the large group of Plone developers, the project is split into several
teams, where each team is responsible for a specific part of the Plone project
such as release management, development, security, infrastructure, usability
and more
\cite{PloneFounders,PloneReleaseManagers,PloneFrameworkTeam,PloneContribute}.

  \label{fig:plone:cba}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Core Developer}

This role is defined to have access to the Plone Core codebase. To become a
member of this role one must have established a track record of contributions
to the Plone project. This is not limited to code, but can also be usability
enhancements or other contributions. It is also highly recommended to attend a
conference or sprint in order to become acquainted with the other developers.
Finally one has to request an account. Informally, Godefroid Chapelle, Hanno
Schlichting and Martin Aspeli serve as gatekeepers for this role. Currently
this role has 375 members.

\paragraph{Framework Team}

This team is responsible for the decision of which code gets into a Plone
release. They do this by recommending code for inclusion to the Plone release
manager team. They are however not responsible for adding new features or
patching bugs, they only drive the \ac{PLIP} process. By accepting or rejecting
\acp{PLIP} they gather information from the community and finally recommend
them to the release manager. Furthermore all significant changes must go
through the framework team. The team consists of a small group of people and
are chosen arbitrarily. Currently the team consists of 16 people.

  \label{fig:plone:cby}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Release Managers}

Each major Plone release is done by a release manager who is responsible for
continuing releases in the specific series. The release manager gets named by
the Plone foundation board and is a paid position
\cite{PlonePaidReleaseManager}. The manager works closely with the framework
team to ensure improvement and continuing development of Plone. The current
release managers are Alec Mitchell, Eric Steele, Hanno Schlichting, Stefan H.
Holek, Wichert Akkerman, Alan Hoey.

\paragraph{Plone Founders}

The Plone founders are Alexander Limi and Alan Runyan. While they do not have
any further rights, both still have a powerful voice in the community and help
with decisions where the community is not able to take one. In some cases they
also take a decision by themselves, overruling the community's proposal.

    distributed between office hours and evenings or weekends, which could be

\subsection{Release Process} % {{{

Since the Plone~4.2 release in 2011 the Plone project changed it's release
process in order to implement a fixed release cycle
\cite{PloneFixedReleaseCycle}. Now every six months, there will be a new Plone
release. Additionally the Plone project sets a feature freeze date two months
before the release at which no new \ac{PLIP} will get accepted unless it has
been completely reviewed by that date.

The Plone project uses a major, minor and micro versioning scheme
\cite{PloneReleaseProcess,PloneCommunityProcesses}. Major releases break
backwards compatibility but may provide an upgrade path. Minor or feature
releases normally provide new features and bug fixes but retain backwards
compatibility. Micro releases are only bug fix releases and do not contain new
features. Additionally, each major and minor release has several preceding
releases. Alpha releases are basically snapshots of the current development
process. Once a beta release gets published, no new feature is allowed to enter
the codebase. Only bug fixes and non-invasive changes are allowed. A release
candidate is published afterwards and only if problems are found, further
release candidates follow. If no show stopper bug comes up, the last release
candidate is considered to be the final version and gets published on the
previously set release date. After that date only bug fix releases are allowed
for this series. The development starts with the next major or minor release.

\subsection{Development} % {{{

\begin{figure}[thbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{plone/commits_by_month}
  \caption[Commits by Month, Plone]
  {Amount of commits per month of core contributors. The two peaks seem to
    refer to the development of Plone~3 and Plone~4.}
  \label{fig:plone:cbm}
\end{figure}

Most of the development of the Plone project is handled through the mailing
list and bug trackers of the project
\cite{PloneContribute,PloneCommunityProcesses}. Minor patches and contributions
often get committed directly to the repository while bigger changes and
features have to go through the \ac{PLIP} process
\cite{PlonePLIPProcess,PloneCommunityProcesses,PlonePLIPLifecycle}. This
process is based on the \acl{PEP} process. New features and big changes have to
be written down in a \ac{PLIP} which contains a description of the feature or
problem, a solution to it and a working implementation. A \ac{PLIP} is always
owned by at least one person who is fully responsible for it.

A \ac{PLIP} mostly derives from a discussion on the \emph{plone-developers}
mailing list. The community will give feedback on the idea and possible
solutions. If the feedback can be considered positive, the creator of the idea
will be asked to write a \ac{PLIP}. However one can also start directly with
the creation of a \ac{PLIP} and get the community feedback during the upcoming
phases.

The author of the \ac{PLIP} is always considered as the main contact point for
future improvements or discussions. From here the \ac{PLIP} life cycle begins
\cite{PlonePLIPLifecycle}.

\paragraph{Draft}

A \ac{PLIP} always starts as draft, where the author summarizes his ideas and
tries to come up with a solution. It is not ready for a proposal but the
discussion already starts and new solutions or ideas find their way into the
\ac{PLIP}.

\paragraph{Proposal}

Once the author thinks that the \ac{PLIP} is finished and will get accepted
they can submit it at any time. The framework team will then comment on any
newly submitted or updated \ac{PLIP}. It will be reviewed and if the framework
team decides that the \ac{PLIP} won't get accepted for Plone Core, the author
is encouraged to improve the \ac{PLIP} and resubmit it at any later point in
time.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Approved}

As soon as the \ac{PLIP} is approved, the author of the \ac{PLIP} starts with
the development of the \ac{PLIP}. A member of the framework team will get
assigned to the \ac{PLIP} and assists the author with any questions and help
they might need.

\paragraph{Rejected}

If the \ac{PLIP} was rejected by the framework team, in most cases the
\ac{PLIP} gets implemented as an amendment and later submitted again as an
improved \ac{PLIP}.

\paragraph{Review}

Once the development is complete, the author of the \ac{PLIP} can forward the
implementation to the framework team. Two members will then review the proposal
along with two additional developers chosen by the author. The reviews have to
be in written form and publicly available to a all members of the community.
This phase should not take longer than two weeks and all critical bugs have to
be fixed before that. If there are too many changes for the available time, the
\ac{PLIP} will be pushed to the next release.

\paragraph{Final Review}

Once all major concerns have been solved, the original reviewers will review
the \ac{PLIP} one more time and confirm that all issues have been resolved and
no new issues have been found. If issues have been found, it goes back to the
Review state.

\paragraph{Accepted}

If the \ac{PLIP} passes the Final Review phase, it can be merged and will be
available in the next Plone release.

\paragraph{Withdrawn}

An author can of course always decide to withdraw the \ac{PLIP} if they think,
that the \ac{PLIP} is no longer needed or obsolete.
